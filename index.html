			<h1>Light</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="main">
			<p>Light is a form of electromagnetic radition with a wavelength which can be detected by the human eye.It is a small part of electromagnetic spectrum and raditation  given by the stars like the Sun.Animals can also see light.The study of light is known as optics.It is an important reserach area in physics.When light hits an object if forms a shadow but when the light hits a transparent object,the light passes through it producing no shadow. Light is an electromagnetic raditation that hows properties of both waves and particles.Light is a form of energy.Light also keeps the Earth warm.Light exists in tiny energy packets  called photons.Each wave has a wavelength or frequency.The human eye sees each wavelength as a different colour.Rainbows show the entire spectrum of visible light.The separate colors,moving in from the outer edges,are usually listed as red,orange,yellow,green,blue,indigo and violet.Other colours can be seen only with special cameras or instruments.Wavelengths below the frequency of red are called infrared,and higher than of violet are called ultraviolet.The other main properties of light are intensity,phase etc. and orbital angular momentum. </p><br>


			<p>In physics,the term light sometime refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength,whether visible or not.The law of reflecion is what allows us to see an object reflected in a mirror.In a vacuum,light moves at the speed of light,which is 299,792,458 meters per  second.This means it takes about 8 minutes for light to reach Earth from the Sun.In glass it travels at about two-thirds as fast.Light moves in a strainght line,creating shadows when the path of light is blocked.More solid things will have a lighter shadow,and transparent things will have none or very less shadow.Light can pass through transparent things the most easily.When light is not in a vacuum,it travles more slowly than its maximum speed of light.The slowest light ever recorded moved at 39 miles per hour.Our eyes react to light,when we see something it reflects,or the light it emits.</p><br>

			<p>Every color of light has a different wavelength.The shorter the wavelength,the more energy the light has.The speed at which light moves does not depend on its energy.Going through partly clear objects can slow light down by a very small amount.White light is made up of many different colors of light added together.When white light shines through a prism,it splits up into different colors,becoming a spectrum.The spectrum contains all of wavelengths of light that we can see.Red light has the longest wavelength,and violet light has the shortest.</p><br>


			<p>Light with a wavelength shorter than violet is called ultraviolet light.X-rays and gamma rays are also forms of light with even shorter wavelengths than ultraviolet.Light with a wavelength longer than redis called infrared light.Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic raditation with a wavelength even longer than infraded light.The microwaves that are used to hear food in a microwave oven are also a form of electromagnetic raditation.Our eyes cannot see those kinds of energy,but there are some cameras that can see them.The various forms of light,both visible and invisible are the electromagnetic spectrum.When light is refrcted in raindrops,a rainbow is made.The raindrops acts like a prism and refracts the light until we can see the colors of the spectrum.</p><br>
			<h2>Color</h2>

			<p>Light and colormare forms of analog information.However,electronic cameras and computer displays work with digital information.Electronic cameras or document scanners make a digital version of a color image by seperating out the full color image into separate red,green and blue images.Later ,a digital display uses pixels of just those three colors.Computer screens use only these three colors in different brightness levels.The brain combines them to see all of the other colors in the image.People think of objects as having color.This is because the molecules that make up the object absorb certain light waves,leaving the other light waves to bounce off.The human eye sees the wavelengthd of all of the light that was not absorbed ,and the combination of those leaves the brain with the impression of a color.</p><br>


			<h2>Electromagnetic Spectrum</h2>
			<p>The entire range of electromagnetic waves is known as electromagnetic spectrum.This also includes electromagnetic energy from gamma rays to radio waves.The electromagnetic spectrum is broadly classfied into different named categories based on the wavelength and characteristics of the energy.The names like "microwave" or "infrared" were developed for convience to describe  electromagnetic raditation with similiar characteristics,but there are no definitive dividing lines between one spectral region or the next.The only region in the electromagnetic spectrum that is elatively consistent in the wavelength definition is the visible specrum,as it corresponds directly with to wavelengthd that human eyes are sensitive to.The visible spectrum is a small window of the entire electromagnetic spectrum</p><br>

			<h2>Speed of Light</h2>
			<p>The speed of ligt,in any medium,which is usally denoted by c,is a physical constant important in many areas of physics.It is denoted by 'c^0' especially  in vacuum medium.It isexaactly 299.792,458 meters per second by definition.A photon travels at this speed in a vacuum.According to special relativity,c is the maximum speed at which all energy,matter,and physical information in the universe can travel.It is the speed of all massless particles such as photons and associated fields-including electromagnetic raditation such as light-in a vacuum.It is predicted by the current theory to be the speed of gravity.Such particles and waves travel at c regardless of the motion of the source or the inertialframe of reference of the observer.In the theory of relativity,c interrelates space and time,and appears in the famous equation of mass-energy equivalence.The special theory of relativity is based on the prediction,so far uphold by obsevations,that the measured speed of light in a vacuum is the same whether or not the source of he light and the person doing the measuring are moving relative to each other.This is sometimes expressed as "the speed of light is independent of the reference frame.</p><br>

			<h2>Optics</h2>
			<p>Optics is the science of light and how it interacts with the woeld.Optics explains how rainbows exist,how light reflects off mirrors,how light refracts through a glass or water and what splits light shining though a prism.In addition to visible light in the standards "spectrum" of red,orange,yellow,green,blue,indigo and violet,optics also deals with invisible parts of the whole electromagnetic spectrumof which visible light is but a small part.Optics is both a science and an area of engineering.It has been used to make many useful things,including eyeglasses,camera,telescopes and microscopes.Mny of these things are based on lenses,which focus light and can make images of things that are bigger or smaller than the original.While optics is an old science,new things are still being discovered in it.Scientists have learned how to make light trvel through a thin optical fibermade of glass or plastic.Light can go long  distances ina fiber.Fibers are used to carry phone calls and the Internet between cities.</p><br>


			<h2>Refraction</h2>
			<p>Refraction is the change in direction of a wave,caused by the change in the wave's speed.Examples of waves include sound waves and light waves,Refraction is seen most often whena wave passes from one transparent medium to another transparent medium.Different types od medium include air and water.When a wave passes from one transparent medium to another transparent medium,the wave will changr its speed and its direction.As light goes into a medium which is denser,the light ray will 'bend' toward the normal.When it goes back into te less dense medium,it will send back through the same angle as when it came in.</p><br>

			<p>A good and simple way to understand how light works is to think of it like a car.When the car hits the gravel surface on anaangle the tire that hits the gravel surface on an angle,the tire that hits it firsr will slow,causing it to turn in that direction.Therefore,if light hits a medium on the right having a greater refractive index,it will bend right.The amount of bending is given by Snell's law.Lenses work by refraction.When light refracts in a prism,it splits into colours of the rainbow because some wavelengths bend more than others.</p><br>
